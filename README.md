# Rectangle Pro Community

Rectangle Pro is a closed source superset of the Rectangle macOS app for window management. 

Since Rectangle Pro is a separate app with much more functionality, this repository is for issues and discussions specifically related to Rectangle Pro.

The [terminal commands for hidden settings in Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle/blob/master/TerminalCommands.md) can also be applied to Rectangle Pro, but you have to change "com.knollsoft.Rectangle" to "com.knollsoft.Hookshot".
